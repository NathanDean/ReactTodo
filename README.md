#React todo app

A React todo app using props, state and hooks which gives the user the ability to:

* Add, edit and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as complete
* Filter tasks according to active or complete status

Copious comments in the code are for my own learning - this has been a great project for helping me to understand how props and callback props are used to pass data between components, how state is used to update data within a component, and the role of hooks in adding additional functionality.
